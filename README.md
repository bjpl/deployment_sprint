## 🎯 Key Findings

### **Project Readiness Matrix**

| Project | Deploy Time | Monthly Cost | Revenue Potential | Priority |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| describe_it | 30-60 min | $5-10 | $500-1000/mo | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| subjunctive_practice | 60 min | $5-30 | $375-1500/mo | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| aves | 2-3 hours | $0 | $200-500/mo | ⭐⭐ |
| open_learn | 2-4 hours | $40-80 | $500-3000/mo | ⭐⭐ |
| corporate_intel | 2-4 hours | $0-100 | $2000-25000/mo | ⭐ |
| llm_workspace | Ready ✅ | $0 | N/A (tools) | ✅ |

### **Recommended Deployment Order**

1. **Week 1:** Deploy describe_it, subjunctive_practice, aves (personal use)
2. **Week 2:** Deploy open_learn, corporate_intel, optimize top 3
3. **Week 3:** Add payments to top 2, prepare for launch
4. **Week 4:** Public launch (ProductHunt, Reddit, Twitter)
5. **Month 2-3:** Scale winners, archive non-performers

### **Path to $1k MRR**

- **Month 1:** $0-100 (deploy, validate)
- **Month 2:** $300-500 (beta, first customers)
- **Month 3:** $800-1500 (grow, optimize)
- **Month 6:** $2000-3000 (scale winners)

**Break-even:** ~18 paying customers across all projects

## 🔥 Critical Insights

### **1. You've Built Too Much (Good Problem!)**

- 6 substantial projects = 240-420 hours to fully commercialize
- **Recommendation:** Focus on 2-3, defer rest
- Quality > Quantity

### **2. Language Learning is Your Cluster**

**Bundle opportunity:**
- 3 projects in same market (Spanish learners)
- Cross-promotion potential
- Bundled pricing: $15/month for all 3
- Shared infrastructure saves costs

### **3. AI Gives You 10x Speed Advantage**

**Traditional solo dev:**
- 1 project at a time
- 12-18 months to revenue

**AI-enabled solo dev (you):**
- 3-6 projects in parallel
- 2-4 months to revenue

**Use Claude Code maximally:**
- Generate all boilerplate
- Create shared component libraries
- Build automation scripts
- Deploy 70% faster

### **4. Deploy in Batches = 50% Time Savings**

**Sequential (slow):**
```
Week 1: Deploy project A (all week)
Week 2: Deploy project B (all week)
Week 3: Deploy project C (all week)
= 3 weeks
```

**Batched (fast):**
```
Monday: Get ALL API keys (2 hours)
Tuesday: Deploy ALL backends (3 hours)
Wednesday: Deploy ALL frontends (2 hours)
= 1.5 days for 3 projects
```
