## 🎯 Test 2: Real Tracker Test (60 seconds)

### **Step 1: Make Changes**

## 📝 Console Verification

**Want to see saves happening in real-time?**

```bash
# Open tracker
start deployment-sprint-tracker.html

# Press F12 (open Developer Console)
# Click "Console" tab

# You'll see:
Sprint Tracker loaded. Version: 1.2
localStorage available: true
Last save: 10/4/2025, 2:45:30 PM

# Make a change (check a task)
State saved successfully. Size: 2 KB

# Wait 30 seconds (background save)
Background auto-save completed: 2:46:00 PM

# Close browser
Saving state before page close...

# Reopen, press F12 again

Last save: 10/4/2025, 2:46:05 PM  ← Same data!
```

**If you see "Last save" with recent timestamp = Data persisted!** ✅

## 🛡️ What Could Go Wrong (And Solutions)

### **Scenario 1: Using Private/Incognito Mode**

**Symptom:** Data disappears when you close browser

**Solution:**
```
Use normal browser mode (not incognito)
localStorage doesn't persist in private mode by design
```

---

### **Scenario 2: Browser Data Cleared**

**Symptom:** All progress gone

**Solution:**
```
Restore from weekly export:
1. Click "📥 Import Progress"
2. Paste your backup JSON
3. Click Import
4. Data restored! ✅
```

---

### **Scenario 3: Different Browser**

**Symptom:** Progress not showing in Chrome when you used Edge

**Solution:**
```
localStorage is per-browser
Export from Edge → Import to Chrome
Or: Stick to one browser for consistency
```

---

## ✅ Final Answer

**YES, 100% SURE:**

✅ localStorage **WILL** persist when you exit and restart
✅ Your MRR **WILL** be saved
✅ All notes **WILL** be saved
✅ All task checkboxes **WILL** be saved
✅ Everything **WILL** be there when you return

**Unless:**
- You're using private/incognito mode
- You manually clear browser data
- Different browser/computer (use export/import)

**Test it yourself right now** (30 seconds):
```bash
start test-localstorage.html
# Click "1. Write Test Data"
# Click "🔄 Reload Page"
# See the data come back ✅
```

**Your deployment sprint progress is SAFE!** 🔒
