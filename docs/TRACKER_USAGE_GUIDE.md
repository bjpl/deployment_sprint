## 🔧 Tips & Tricks

### **Tip 1: Expand Only Current Week**

Don't expand all weeks at once (overwhelming).

```
✅ DO: Expand only current week
   - Less visual clutter
   - Focus on today
   - See this week's progress

❌ DON'T: Expand all 8 weeks
   - Too much scrolling
   - Hard to find current tasks
   - Overwhelming
```

### **Tip 2: Use the 5-Tab Journal System**

Each day has 5 note categories - use them all for best results:

**📋 Summary Tab** (Quick overview):
```
Deployed describe_it and subjunctive_practice successfully.
Both apps tested and working. Started beta recruitment.
Overall: Productive day, ahead of schedule.
```

**🎉 Wins Tab** (Celebrate successes):
```
• Successfully deployed describe_it to Vercel (works perfectly!)
• Fixed CORS bug in subjunctive_practice
• Got first 5 beta signups for describe_it
• All health checks passing
• Learned how to use Railway CLI efficiently
```

**🚧 Blockers Tab** (Track issues):
```
• Stripe webhook not triggering (need to debug tomorrow)
• Waiting for Unsplash API key approval (applied today)
• aves build still has TypeScript errors (defer to Day 2)
```

**💡 Decisions Tab** (Document choices):
```
• Decided to focus on describe_it + subjunctive (used both 5+ times)
• Pricing decision: $4.99/month for Pro tier (competitive with market)
• Will defer aves deployment until Month 2 (low personal usage)
• Using Railway over DigitalOcean (easier deployment)
```

**➡️ Tomorrow Tab** (Plan ahead):
```
• Fix Stripe webhook issue first thing (30 min)
• Deploy aves to GitHub Pages (3 hours)
• Test all apps on mobile devices
• Create unified monitoring dashboard
• Energy goal: Keep it to 8 hours max
```

**Why this system works:**
- Structured thinking (not random notes)
- Easy to review later (categorized)
- Celebrates wins (important for motivation!)
- Tracks blockers (don't forget to fix)
- Plans ahead (hit ground running tomorrow)

**Pro tip:** Switch tabs as you go through your day:
- Morning: Check "Tomorrow" tab from yesterday
- During: Add to "Blockers" as they happen
- Wins: Record immediately (don't wait!)
- Evening: Fill "Summary" and "Tomorrow" tabs

---

### **Tip 3: Use Task Notes for Technical Details**

Task-level notes are perfect for:

**Example - Deploy describe_it Task:**
```
📝 Task Notes:

Commands used:
• npm install -g vercel
• vercel login
• vercel --prod
• vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL

Issues encountered:
• Initial deployment failed - missing env variable
• Fixed by adding all NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars
• Build took 2m 15s

Actual time: 45 minutes (estimated 1 hour)

Resources:
• https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables
• Supabase URL: https://xxx.supabase.co

Notes for next time:
• Remember to add ALL env vars before deploying
• Check vercel.json is in root directory
```

**When to use task notes vs day notes:**
- **Task notes:** Technical details, commands, specific to this task
- **Day notes:** Strategic overview, decisions affecting multiple tasks

**Button states:**
- "➕ Add Note" = No note yet (grey button)
- "📝 View Note" = Note exists (blue button)
- Click to expand, type, auto-saves, click to close

**Saving behavior:**
- Auto-save: 1 second after you stop typing (automatic)
- Manual save: Click "💾 Save" button (immediate)
- Button feedback: "💾 Save" → "✅ Saved!" for 1.5 seconds
- Both work together (use whichever you prefer)

**Pro tip for task notes:**
- Add notes WHILE working (not after)
- Save commands you run (copy/paste later)
- Document errors + solutions (learning)
- Record actual time vs estimate (improve planning)

### **Tip 4: Adjust the Plan**

The plan is a GUIDE, not gospel:

**If ahead of schedule:**
- Check off multiple days at once
- Add extra tasks if desired
- Move to next week early

**If behind schedule:**
- That's OK! Real life happens
- Adjust time estimates
- Focus on high-priority tasks only
- Skip low-priority tasks

**If plans change:**
- Use notes to document pivots
- Mark deferred tasks as "N/A" in notes
- Focus on what matters to YOU

### **Tip 4: Export Weekly**

Don't lose your progress:

**Weekly backup routine:**
```
Sunday evening:
1. Click "💾 Export Progress"
2. Copy JSON
3. Save to: ~/Dropbox/sprint-backups/week-X.json
4. Close tracker
5. Sleep well knowing progress is safe
```
