## 🔧 Tips & Tricks

### **Tip 1: Expand Only Current Week**

Don't expand all weeks at once (overwhelming).

```
✅ DO: Expand only current week
   - Less visual clutter
   - Focus on today
   - See this week's progress

❌ DON'T: Expand all 8 weeks
   - Too much scrolling
   - Hard to find current tasks
   - Overwhelming
```

### **Tip 2: Use Notes Liberally**

The notes section is your journal:

**Good daily notes:**
```
Day 4 Notes:
- describe_it deployed successfully
- Bug: Image search fails for special characters (reported to Claude)
- Decision: Focus on describe_it + subjunctive (used both 5+ times)
- Tomorrow: Fix search bug, deploy aves
- Energy: 4/5 (productive day!)
```

**Update metrics at gates:**
```
Day 13 Metrics:
- Beta users: 18 (9 per app)
- Retention: 65% (11 used 3+ times)
- NPS: 78% (14 would recommend)
- Willing to pay: 55% (10 said yes/maybe)
- Decision: PROCEED to monetization for both apps
```

### **Tip 3: Adjust the Plan**

The plan is a GUIDE, not gospel:

**If ahead of schedule:**
- Check off multiple days at once
- Add extra tasks if desired
- Move to next week early

**If behind schedule:**
- That's OK! Real life happens
- Adjust time estimates
- Focus on high-priority tasks only
- Skip low-priority tasks

**If plans change:**
- Use notes to document pivots
- Mark deferred tasks as "N/A" in notes
- Focus on what matters to YOU

### **Tip 4: Export Weekly**

Don't lose your progress:

**Weekly backup routine:**
```
Sunday evening:
1. Click "💾 Export Progress"
2. Copy JSON
3. Save to: ~/Dropbox/sprint-backups/week-X.json
4. Close tracker
5. Sleep well knowing progress is safe
```
