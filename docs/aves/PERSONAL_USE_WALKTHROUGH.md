## Quick Start (2-3 Hours)

**Objective**: Get a working vocabulary learning app you can use TODAY

### Phase 1: Fix TypeScript Build (30 minutes)

#### Your Manual Tasks (5 minutes)

**Decision**: Choose build fix strategy

**Option A - Quick Fix (Recommended)**:
Exclude test files from production build

**Option B - Fix All Tests**:
Fix the 73 failing tests (takes 3-4 hours)

**What to tell Claude**:
```
"Claude, exclude all test files from the production build.
Update tsconfig.json to ignore __tests__ directories.
Strategy: Quick fix - tests not needed for deployment."
```

#### Claude's Automated Work (15 minutes)

Claude will:
1. ‚úÖ Update `frontend/tsconfig.json`
2. ‚úÖ Add exclude patterns for test files
3. ‚úÖ Verify build configuration
4. ‚úÖ Run test build
5. ‚úÖ Report success

**Expected Output**:
```json
// frontend/tsconfig.json changes
{
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules",
    "dist",
    "**/__tests__",
    "**/*.test.ts",
    "**/*.test.tsx",
    "**/__mocks__"
  ]
}
```

#### Your Verification (10 minutes)

```bash
# Test the build
cd frontend
npm run build

# Should complete without errors
# Output: dist/ folder created with compiled app
```

**Success Criteria**: Build completes with no TypeScript errors

---

### Phase 2: Create Static Exercise Data (1.5 hours)

#### Your Manual Tasks (30 minutes)

**Decision 1**: How many exercises do you want initially?
- **Option A**: 20 exercises (minimum viable, 30 min)
- **Option B**: 50 exercises (good coverage, 1.5 hours)
- **Option C**: 100 exercises (comprehensive, 3 hours)

**Decision 2**: Which exercise types?
- ‚úÖ Visual Discrimination (identify bird by image)
- ‚úÖ Contextual Fill (complete Spanish sentences)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Audio Recognition (requires audio files - skip for now)
- ‚úÖ Translation Practice (Spanish ‚Üî English)
- ‚úÖ Vocabulary Matching (match terms to definitions)

**What to tell Claude**:
```
"Claude, create 50 static exercises in data/exercises.json using the 10 existing species and 10 annotations.

Exercise types:
- 15 Visual Discrimination (identify bird by Spanish name)
- 15 Contextual Fill (complete sentences with vocabulary)
- 10 Translation Practice (bird names Spanish ‚Üî English)
- 10 Vocabulary Matching (anatomical terms)

Use the data from:
- data/species.json (10 birds)
- data/annotations.json (10 vocabulary terms)

Make them progressively harder:
- Level 1 (Easy): 20 exercises - common birds, basic terms
- Level 2 (Medium): 20 exercises - mixed difficulty
- Level 3 (Hard): 10 exercises - full sentences, etymology

Format each exercise as:
{
  'id': 'ex-001',
  'type': 'visual-discrimination',
  'question': 'Spanish question text',
  'correctAnswer': 'answer',
  'options': ['answer', 'distractor1', 'distractor2', 'distractor3'],
  'difficulty': 1-3,
  'hints': ['helpful hint if needed']
}
"
```

#### Claude's Automated Work (45 minutes)

Claude will:
1. ‚úÖ Read `data/species.json` (10 birds)
2. ‚úÖ Read `data/annotations.json` (10 vocabulary terms)
3. ‚úÖ Generate 50 exercises across 4 types
4. ‚úÖ Create realistic distractors (wrong answers that are plausible)
5. ‚úÖ Add difficulty progression
6. ‚úÖ Write to `data/exercises.json`
7. ‚úÖ Validate JSON format
8. ‚úÖ Report exercise breakdown

**Expected Output**:
```json
// data/exercises.json (sample)
[
  {
    "id": "ex-001",
    "type": "visual-discrimination",
    "question": "¬øQu√© p√°jaro tiene plumas rojas?",
    "correctAnswer": "sp-001",
    "options": ["sp-001", "sp-002", "sp-003", "sp-004"],
    "difficulty": 1,
    "explanation": "El cardenal rojo tiene plumas rojas brillantes.",
    "relatedVocabulary": ["plumas rojas", "cardenal"]
  },
  {
    "id": "ex-002",
    "type": "contextual-fill",
    "question": "El cardenal usa su ____ fuerte para romper semillas.",
    "correctAnswer": "pico",
    "options": ["pico", "alas", "cola", "patas"],
    "difficulty": 1,
    "explanation": "'Pico' significa beak en ingl√©s.",

- **Option A**: 30 species (manageable, 2 hours)
- **Option B**: 50 species (good coverage, 4 hours)
- **Option C**: 100+ species (comprehensive, 6+ hours)

**Decision 2**: Which species to add?

**Recommended Approach**:
```
"Claude, analyze the 10 existing species and suggest 40 more that:
1. Cover diverse habitats (forest, wetland, coastal, urban)
2. Represent different sizes (tiny to very large)
3. Include both common and interesting species
4. Span North/Central/South America
5. Have distinctive Spanish names

Create a prioritized list with rationale."
```

**Decision 3**: Data sources
- ‚úÖ Use existing data structure
- ‚úÖ Source images from Unsplash (free tier: 50 requests/hour)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Audio: Skip for now OR use Google TTS

**What to tell Claude**:
```
"Claude, expand the species database to 50 birds total (40 new + 10 existing).

For each new species, create entries in:
1. data/species.json - full taxonomy and metadata
2. data/annotations.json - 2-3 vocabulary terms per bird
3. data/exercises.json - 5 exercises per bird

Use this process:
1. Research 40 bird species with distinctive Spanish names
2. Find Unsplash images for each (search: '[bird name] bird')
3. Create 2-3 anatomical/color vocabulary annotations per bird
4. Generate 5 exercises per bird (mix of types)

Total output:
- 50 species in species.json
- 120 annotations (40 birds √ó 3 terms average)
- 250 exercises (50 birds √ó 5 exercises)

Maintain consistent quality and difficulty progression."
```

#### Claude's Automated Work (3-5 hours)

```
Claude will present something like:

"I've researched 40 species. Here are the top candidates:

Priority 1 (Common + Distinctive) - 15 species:
1. Colibr√≠ Ermita√±o (Hermit Hummingbird) - tiny, forest, iridescent
2. Tuc√°n Pico Iris (Keel-billed Toucan) - large, colorful beak
3. Quetzal (Resplendent Quetzal) - culturally significant
...

Priority 2 (Educational Value) - 15 species:
...

Priority 3 (Interesting) - 10 species:
...

Approve all 40? Or would you like to substitute any?"
```

You respond:
```
"Approved. Proceed with all 40."
OR
"Replace #7 and #15 with [alternatives]. Then proceed."
```

**Batch 2-4 Reviews** (15 min each):
- Spot-check 5-10 entries for quality
- Verify Spanish is correct
- Approve to continue

#### Your Verification (30 minutes)

1. **Data Validation**:
```bash
# Check file sizes grew
ls -lh data/
# species.json should be ~40KB (was ~8KB)
# annotations.json should be ~60KB (was ~5KB)
# exercises.json should be ~120KB (new)

# Validate JSON
cat data/species.json | jq length
# Should output: 50

cat data/annotations.json | jq length
# Should output: ~120

cat data/exercises.json | jq length
# Should output: 250
```

2. **Quality Spot Check**:
```bash
# Check a random species
cat data/species.json | jq '.[25]'

# Check a random exercise
cat data/exercises.json | jq '.[100]'
```

3. **Test In App**:
```bash
npm run dev
# Browse to species page
# Should see 50 birds
# Filter by habitat ‚Üí should work
# Try 10 exercises ‚Üí should have variety
```

**Success Criteria**:
- 50 species with images
- 120+ vocabulary terms
- 250 exercises
- All data validates
- App works with new data

### Phase 6: Audio Pronunciation (2-3 hours)

**Note**: This is optional but highly valuable for language learning.

#### Your Manual Tasks (30 minutes)

**Decision 1**: Audio source strategy

**Option A - Google Text-to-Speech** (Recommended):
- Free for low usage
- Good Spanish pronunciation
- Easy to automate
- Claude can generate audio files

**Option B - Manual Recording**:
- Your own voice (most authentic)
- Record 120 terms √ó 2-3 seconds each = ~6 minutes of audio
- Time-consuming but personal

**Option C - Skip Audio**:
- Defer to later
- Focus on text-based learning first

**What to tell Claude** (if choosing Option A):
```
"Claude, generate audio pronunciation files for all 120 vocabulary terms using Google TTS.

Requirements:
1. Use Spanish (es-ES or es-MX) voice
2. Generate MP3 files
3. File naming: audio/[spanishTerm]-pronunciation.mp3
4. Save metadata in audio/manifest.json
5. Update annotations.json with audioUrl field

Process:
1. Extract all unique spanishTerm values from annotations.json
2. Use Google Cloud TTS API to generate audio
3. Save to public/audio/ directory (for GitHub Pages)
4. Update data references

Note: I'll provide Google Cloud credentials separately."
```

#### Claude's Automated Work (1.5 hours)

**Prerequisites**: You need Google Cloud account with TTS API enabled

Claude will:
1. ‚úÖ Extract 120 unique vocabulary terms
2. ‚úÖ Generate TTS script
3. ‚úÖ Call Google Cloud TTS API (you run the script)

```bash
# Claude will create something like:
node scripts/generate-audio.js

# This will:
# - Read annotations.json
# - Call Google TTS for each term
# - Save MP3s to public/audio/
# - Take ~30 min for 120 terms (rate limiting)
```

3. **Verify Audio Files** (10 min):
```bash
# Check files created
ls public/audio/*.mp3 | wc -l
# Should show: 120

# Test a sample
open public/audio/pico-pronunciation.mp3
# Should hear: "PEE-koh"
```

#### Your Verification (10 minutes)

1. **Test in App**:
```bash
npm run dev
# Navigate to annotation
# Click speaker icon
# Audio should play
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: TypeScript Build Still Fails

**Symptoms**: Errors after excluding test files

**Solution**:
```
"Claude, the build is still failing with these errors:
[paste error messages]

Please fix the TypeScript configuration to exclude all test-related code from production build."
```

### Issue: Exercises Don't Load

**Symptoms**: Exercise page shows error or empty state

**Diagnostics**:
```bash
# Check if exercises.json exists
ls -la data/exercises.json

# Validate JSON
cat data/exercises.json | jq empty
# If error, JSON is malformed

# Check browser console
# Open DevTools ‚Üí Console tab
# Look for fetch errors or parse errors
```

**Solutions**:
- JSON syntax error ‚Üí Ask Claude to fix
- File not found ‚Üí Verify path in `clientDataService.ts`
- CORS error ‚Üí Check GitHub Pages deployment

### Issue: Audio Doesn't Play

**Symptoms**: Click speaker icon, no sound

**Diagnostics**:
```bash
# Check if audio files exist
ls public/audio/*.mp3

# Check browser console for 404 errors
```

**Solutions**:
- Files missing ‚Üí Re-run audio generation
- Wrong path ‚Üí Check `annotations.json` audioUrl field
- Browser blocked ‚Üí Check autoplay permissions

### Issue: GitHub Pages Shows 404

**Symptoms**: Deployment succeeded but site doesn't load

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check GitHub Pages settings
# Repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Pages
# Should be: Source: gh-pages branch, / (root)

# Check base path in vite.config.ts
# Should be: base: '/aves/'

# Rebuild and redeploy
npm run build
git add dist/ -f
git commit -m "Fix deployment"
git push
```

### Issue: No One Signed Up for Premium

**Symptoms**: Launched, but 0 conversions after 1 week

**Diagnostics**:
- Check: Did anyone reach pricing page?
- Check: What's the free tier usage rate?
- Check: Is paywall triggering correctly?

**Solutions**:

**If no one reached pricing page**:
‚Üí Positioning problem. Free tier might be too generous.
‚Üí Action: Make free tier smaller (5 species instead of 10)

**If people reached pricing but didn't buy**:
‚Üí Price too high or value unclear
‚Üí Action:
  - Add 7-day free trial
  - Lower price to $2.99/mo
  - Add testimonials/social proof

**If free tier usage is low**:
‚Üí Product problem, not pricing
‚Üí Action: Improve core experience before monetizing
