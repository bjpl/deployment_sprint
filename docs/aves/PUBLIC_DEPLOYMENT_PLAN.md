# AVES Public Deployment Plan

**Goal**: Launch for other users as fast as possible
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Current Status**: 70% ready, needs exercises and polish

---

## Executive Summary

**You're closer than you think.** Here's what you need to launch publicly:

| Current State | What's Missing | Time to Fix |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| ✅ App deployed on GitHub Pages | ❌ Build broken (test files) | 30 min |
| ✅ 10 species with data | ❌ Only 10 species (need 30-50) | 4-6 hours |
| ✅ 10 vocabulary terms | ⚠️ No exercises to practice | 2 hours |
| ✅ Client-side storage works | ⚠️ No onboarding for new users | 1 hour |
| ✅ Dual-mode architecture | ⚠️ No "About" or "How It Works" page | 1 hour |

**Total to MVP for public use**: **8-10 hours of work**

**Recommended timeline**:
- **Weekend 1**: Fix build, create exercises, expand species (8 hours)
- **Week 1**: Beta test with 5-10 people (minimal effort, just observe)
- **Weekend 2**: Polish based on feedback, create marketing (4 hours)
- **Week 2**: Public launch (2 hours setup, ongoing support)

## The Fast-Track Plan (10 Days)

### Day 1-2 (Weekend): Build MVP (8 hours)

#### Saturday Morning (3 hours)
**Phase 1: Fix & Create Core Exercises**

**Your work (30 min):**
```
Tell Claude:
"I want to launch publicly in 10 days. Let's start with the essentials.

Step 1: Fix the build (exclude test files)
Step 2: Create 100 exercises using existing 10 species
  - 30 Visual Discrimination
  - 30 Contextual Fill-in-Blank
  - 20 Translation (Spanish → English)
  - 20 Vocabulary Matching

Make them engaging and progressively harder (3 difficulty levels).
This is for public launch, so quality matters."
```

**Claude's work (2 hours):**
- Fix TypeScript build
- Generate 100 high-quality exercises
- Validate all data
- Test build

**Your verification (30 min):**
```bash
npm run build  # Should work
npm run dev    # Test locally
# Complete 10 exercises to verify quality
```

#### Saturday Afternoon (4 hours)
**Phase 2: Expand Content**

**Your work (30 min):**
```
Tell Claude:
"Expand to 40 bird species total (30 new).

Requirements for new species:
- Popular/recognizable birds (cardinal, robin, eagle, owl, etc.)
- Good mix of sizes and habitats
- Each needs: Spanish name, English name, habitat, colors, behavior
- Find Unsplash images for each
- Create 2-3 vocabulary annotations per bird
- Generate 5 exercises per new bird (150 more exercises)

Priority: North American birds that Spanish learners might see.

Total output:
- 40 species in species.json
- ~100 vocabulary annotations total
- 250 exercises total"
```

**Claude's work (3 hours):**
- Research 30 bird species
- Find Unsplash images
- Create species data
- Generate 90 vocabulary annotations
- Create 150 more exercises
- Validate all JSON

**Your verification (30 min):**
```bash
cat data/species.json | jq length     # Should show 40
cat data/annotations.json | jq length # Should show ~100
cat data/exercises.json | jq length   # Should show 250

npm run dev
# Browse species - should see 40 birds
# Try 20 exercises - verify variety and quality
```

#### Saturday Evening (1 hour)
**Phase 3: User Onboarding**

**Your work (15 min):**
```
Tell Claude:
"Create user onboarding for first-time visitors:

1. Welcome modal on first visit:
   - Explains what AVES is (Spanish bird vocabulary learning)
   - Shows 3 quick steps: Browse birds → Learn terms → Practice exercises
   - 'Get Started' button to dismiss

2. Create an 'About' page (/about):
   - What is AVES?
   - How does it work? (visual learning, spaced repetition)
   - Who is it for? (Spanish learners, birdwatchers, teachers)
   - Features list
   - 'Try it now' CTA

3. Add 'How It Works' section to home page:
   - 3 steps with icons
   - Visual workflow diagram

Use existing component patterns. Keep it simple and friendly."
```

**Claude's work (40 min):**
- Create welcome modal component
- Create About page
- Add to routing
- Update home page

**Your verification (5 min):**
- Clear localStorage, reload → should see welcome
- Visit /about → should explain the app
- Check home page → clear value proposition

• Visual learning > rote memorization
• GitHub Pages is perfect for static education apps

Key features:

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built AVES to solve my own problem - I was learning Spanish
and planning a bird-watching trip to Costa Rica. Wanted to learn
bird names but traditional flashcards were boring.

So I created an interactive visual learning platform.

Tech stack:
- React + TypeScript
- Vite for blazing fast builds
- IndexedDB for client-side storage
- GitHub Pages for hosting (100% free)
- Built with Claude Code for 2.8-4.4x development speed

Happy to answer questions about the app or the AI-assisted
development process!
```

## What Could Go Wrong (And How to Handle It)

### Scenario 1: No One Uses It

**If <50 visitors in Week 1:**

**Likely reasons:**
- Posting at wrong times
- Not enough distribution channels
- Landing page unclear

**Fix:**
- Post to more Spanish learning communities
- Ask friends to share
- Improve home page value proposition
- Create better demo video

### Scenario 2: People Visit But Don't Complete Exercises

**If >100 visitors but <10 complete exercises:**

**Likely reasons:**
- Onboarding unclear
- Exercises too hard or boring
- Technical issues

**Fix:**
- Add tutorial/demo exercise
- Review exercise difficulty
- Test on different devices
- Simplify first exercise

### Scenario 3: Negative Feedback

**If >40% negative feedback:**

**Likely reasons:**
- Major bugs
- Not solving real problem
- Target audience wrong

**Fix:**
- Fix bugs immediately
- Talk to users (email, Discord)
- Reconsider who this is for
- May need to pivot

### Scenario 4: Unexpected Popularity

**If 1000+ visitors in Week 1:**

**Great problem to have!**

**Prepare for:**
- GitHub Pages bandwidth limits (unlikely but possible)
- Support requests
- Feature requests
- People wanting to contribute

**Do:**
- Set up proper issue tracking on GitHub
- Create CONTRIBUTING.md (if open source)
- Respond to all feedback
- Don't promise features you can't deliver

---

## After Launch: Next Steps

### Week 3-4: Decide on Direction

**Option A: Keep Free, Grow Organically**

**If:**
- Good user engagement (>50 daily active)
- Positive feedback (>70%)
- BUT low willingness to pay (<30%)

**Do:**
- Focus on content expansion (100+ species)
- SEO optimization
- Community building
- Maybe add donations (Buy Me a Coffee)

**Time investment:** 5 hours/week

---

**Option B: Build Freemium**

**If:**
- Solid free tier usage (>100 weekly active)
- Strong willingness to pay (>50%)
- Specific premium features requested

**Do:**
- Expand to 200 species (premium)
- Add AI exercise generation (premium)
- Implement Stripe payments
- Create premium tier at $4.99/mo

**Time investment:** 15-20 hours over 2-3 weeks

---

**Option C: Explore B2B**

**If:**
- Teachers/schools interested
- Language learning companies reaching out
- Strong educational value validated

**Do:**
- Create teacher dashboard
- Bulk licensing
- Custom vocabulary sets
- LMS integration

**Time investment:** 20-30 hours (but higher revenue potential)
