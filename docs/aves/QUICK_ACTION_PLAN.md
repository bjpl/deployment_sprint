## Quick Start (2-3 Hours)

### Phase 1: Fix Build (30 min)

**You say to Claude:**
```
"Claude, exclude all test files from the production build.
Update tsconfig.json to ignore __tests__ directories."
```

**Claude does:** Updates config, tests build, reports success

**You verify:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build  # Should complete with no errors
```

---

### Phase 2: Create Exercises (1.5 hours)

**You say to Claude:**
```
"Claude, create 50 static exercises in data/exercises.json
using the 10 existing species and 10 annotations.

Exercise types:
- 15 Visual Discrimination (identify bird by Spanish name)
- 15 Contextual Fill (complete sentences)
- 10 Translation Practice (Spanish â†” English)
- 10 Vocabulary Matching (terms to definitions)

Make them progressively harder (Level 1-3).
Use data from species.json and annotations.json."
```

**Claude does:** Reads data, generates 50 exercises, writes JSON, validates

**You verify:**
```bash
cat data/exercises.json | jq length  # Should output: 50
npm run dev                          # Test exercises work
```

---

### Phase 3: Deploy (30 min)

**You do:**
```bash
npm run build
git add .
git commit -m "Add static exercises for personal use"
git push
npm run deploy
```

**Wait 2-5 minutes, then visit:** `https://[username].github.io/aves/`

**Test checklist:**
- [ ] Species browser loads (10 birds)
- [ ] Complete 5 exercises
- [ ] Progress saves (refresh page, progress persists)
- [ ] Works on mobile

**SUCCESS!** You have a working vocabulary learning app.

---

## What's Next?

### Use It For 1 Week

**Daily routine** (15 min/day):
1. Visit your deployed app
2. Complete 10 exercises
3. Note what works and what's frustrating

**After 1 week, ask yourself:**

| Question | Yes | No |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Did I use it 5+ days? | â†’ Continue to Full Features | â†’ Identify blockers |
| Would I pay $5/mo for more? | â†’ Consider monetization | â†’ Keep as free tool |
| Would I recommend to a friend? | â†’ Share with beta testers | â†’ Improve first |

---

## Full Features (If You Want More)

### Content Expansion

**You say to Claude:**
```
"Claude, expand to 50 bird species (40 new).
For each: species data, 3 annotations, 5 exercises.
Total output: 50 species, 120 annotations, 250 exercises."
```

**Time**: 4-6 hours (Claude does most work)

---

### Audio Pronunciation

**You say to Claude:**
```
"Claude, generate audio for all 120 vocabulary terms
using Google Text-to-Speech. Spanish (es-ES) voice.
Save to public/audio/ and update annotations.json."
```

**Time**: 2-3 hours (includes Google Cloud setup)

```
"Claude, add:
1. Progress Dashboard (stats, streak, accuracy)

3. Export/Import Progress
4. Dark Mode
5. Keyboard Shortcuts"
```

**Time**: 2-3 hours

## Freemium Launch (If You Want Revenue)
